# Lab 1: Building a Neural Network using Python

Welcome to Lab 1 of the Machine Learning Series.

We first present to you a problem to solve here. How can you train a computer to divide the blue dots from the red as shown in this picture?

In this lab, you will implement a simple neural network, which loads some pre-trained weights and attempts to deal with the above  problem.

To run this lab, you have to do the folllowing:

1. Complete the sigmoid activation function using python and numpy in neuralnetworkv2.py

2. Complete the forward propagation part in neuralnetworkv2.py

3. Run "python run_examples.py" using Python 2.7, 3.0 or above
